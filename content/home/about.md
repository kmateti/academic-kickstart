# Biography

I am currently with the R&D group at JBT Automated Guided Vehicles in Chalfont, PA.  Our robots are big wheeled automatic forklift vehicles that are host controlled, navigate within 5 mm, use 3D cameras to detect loads and obstacles, and stop on a dime if someone is in the way.  In any given day, I can be integrating 3D camera detection software, analyzing AC motor controllers, modeling vehicle dynamics, developing LIDAR navigation algorithms, and creating tools for data analysis for field engineers.  I code in Matlab, C++, and Python, in that order.  I am constantly pushing myself to learn more, while trying to be a good father, husband, and son.  If this website is not up to date, it is because it is not up to date.
